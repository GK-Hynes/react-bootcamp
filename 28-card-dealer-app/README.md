# Card Dealer App

A card dealer app built to practice working with lifecycle methods.

The app fetches a deck of cards from the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/). When a user clicks the button, the app sends another request to the API, this time to `https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/${deck_id}/draw/`. The data from the response displays a new card. The user can continue to "draw" cards until the deck is empty.
