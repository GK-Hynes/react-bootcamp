A version of Tiger's classic 1995 game, Lights Out. This version was built to practice handling state and events across different components.

You can click on a cell to toggle that light â€” but it also toggles the light above it, to the left of it, to the right of it, and below it.

The puzzle is won when all the lights are turned off.
