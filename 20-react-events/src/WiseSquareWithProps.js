/*
 Three common ways to bind this:

 1. Inline
  - Very explicit
  - But must be bound multiple times if passed to multiple components
 - A new function is created on every render

 2. Arrow Functions
  - No mention of bind
  - Less clear
  - Runs into the same problems if you need to pass the fn to multiple components

 3. Bind in the constructor 
  - Only need to bind once
  - More performant
  - Subjectively ugly...
